Design goals

This asset is a client side software component that can detect emotions from playersâ€™ faces. 
The software detects emotions in real-time. 
It returns a string representing six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, and anger. 
It can also detect the neutral face.

The client side version is designed to run directly in the client applications including games and serious games. 
It is possible to use it for instance in games for communication training and conflict management. 
It is alos possible to use it in games to collect emotion data during play testing.


Integration

You can easily integrate this module on your game or your software application as follows:

1. Clone your asset in you 'Asset' folder.

2. You need to use an external library called dlib. 
We have wrapped up the required dlib files in two dll files called dlib wrapper 64 and 86. 
The dlib wrapper is a C# wrapper over the dlib C++ library. 
The Dlib's open source licensing allows you to use it in any application even in commercial applications, free of charge. 
It is freely available at http://dlib.net.

3. Make sure that the following directories have been cloned on your 'Asset' folder:
3.1. The 'EmotionDetectionAsset': 
That is an asset for realtime emotion detection through loading an static image file, a recorded video file, or a live webcam stream.

3.2. The 'EmotionDetectionAsset_Demo':
That provides a demo version of the asset.

3.3. The 'EmotionDetectionAsset':
That provides portable version of the asset.

3.4. The 'EmotionDetectionAsset_Test':
That let you test your EmotionDetectionAsset. 
The 'EmotionDetectionAsset_Test' is not necessary and can be safely removed.

Dependencies

RAGE Assets:

1. This software depends on the 'AssetManager' asset of the RAGE project. 
You can also download it separately from https://github.com/rageappliedgame/AssetManager.

2. It also depends on the 'RAGEAssetManager_Portable', which provides portable version of the AssetManager.
You can also download it from https://github.com/rageappliedgame/AssetManager.

Platform:

1. Runs as a separate client-side application on Windows 7, 8, and 10.

2. Runs as a demo prototype on Unity.

Used by:
All the games that want to collect player's facial expressions and provide the six basic emotions:
